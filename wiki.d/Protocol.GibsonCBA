text=CBA stands for Chew Back Assembly, referring to the single strand exonuclease which degraded the homologous ends of the inserts and backbones allowing for annealing, extension and ligation (isothermal "one-pot" reaction)%0a%0aAttached is the protocol from Justin Chew in the [[http://rustlab.uchicago.edu/|Rust lab]]%0a%0aAnd some notes from Justin Chew%0a%0a->I've attached my protocol for making 2X Gibson assembly mix, which has worked well for me.%0a%0a->As far as prepping the backbone, I've tried PCR but my backbone is a little too long for me to get much yield from this.  I always do a single blunt end cut, and I actually don't use phosphatase since I do colony PCR screens before sending my plasmids in for sequencing (in practice, I get anywhere from 0-25%25 self-ligations out of all the colonies I pick), so I'd expect to get background even lower if you use phosphatase.%0a%0a->Also, be sure to follow NEB's guidelines for transformations - this means diluting by 3-fold for electroporation and 4-fold for chemical transformation.%0a%0a->One more note: since the ligase is the most expensive component, I've ordered it from both NEB and another company that provided it for cheaper (I'll need to dig up the name of that company if you are interested).  The Gibson assembly with the other company's ligase definitely worked, but it made it impossible for me to electroporate successfully, and my hunch is that the ligase buffer from that company had too many salts.  So just be aware of this when shopping for ligase or other components of the mix!%0a%0aAlso the link to the Open Wetware [[http://openwetware.org/wiki/Gibson_Assembly |protocol]] version%0a%0aFrom their site%0a%0a#Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.%0a#Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture.
